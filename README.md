# Vultr Markdown Toolkit (MDTK)

MDTK is a helpful aid for authors who write Markdown, consisting of Vale style rules, Vultr vocabulary, a recommended set of Visual Studio Code extensions, and a workspace file that sets the preferred defaults.

## How to Install MDTK

1. Install the required components:

    * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    * [Vale CLI](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/)
    * [Vale Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chrischinchilla.vale-vscode)
    * [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
    * [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

1. Clone the [vultr/vultr-mdtk](https://github.com/vultr/vultr-mdtk) repository to a folder on your workstation.
1. Open `vultr-mdtk.code-workspace` with Visual Studio Code. This workspace configures the correct options for Vale and the Markdown extensions.
1. Edit your Markdown files in the `Markdown` folder. *Errors* are underlined in red, *Warnings* in yellow, and *Suggestions* in blue. You can hover over the alerts for pop-up help.
